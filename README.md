# FM 90.1

Welcome to the FM 90.1 project! This project involves the generation of a frequency of 90.1 Hz, which can be used for making announcements in various places such as colleges, industries, hospitals, schools, and more. The project utilizes a condenser microphone amplifier circuit with the V2.0 module. This module communicates with the Arduino UNO R3. The main components used in this project are an FM Transmitter, Arduino UNO, power supply, and male-to-male cable.

## Features

- Frequency Generation: The project generates a stable frequency of 90.1 Hz, which is ideal for broadcasting announcements.

- Condenser Microphone Amplifier: The condenser microphone amplifier circuit ensures clear and amplified audio input for broadcasting.

- Arduino UNO Integration: The FM 90.1 module communicates with the Arduino UNO R3, enabling control and customization of the broadcasting process.

## Components Used

The following components are used in the FM 90.1 project:

- FM Transmitter: Responsible for transmitting the generated frequency to the desired broadcasting range.

- Arduino UNO R3: Acts as the central controller, facilitating communication between the FM 90.1 module and the transmitter.

- Power Supply: Provides the necessary power to operate the FM transmitter and the Arduino UNO.

- Male-to-Male Cable: Used for connecting the FM 90.1 module to the Arduino UNO for data transfer.
